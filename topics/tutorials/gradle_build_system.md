The [gradle-intellij-plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-intellij-plugin) Gradle plugin is the recommended solution for building IntelliJ Platform plugins.
The plugin takes care of the dependencies of your plugin project - both the base IDE and other plugin dependencies.
It provides tasks to run the IDE with your plugin and to package and publish your plugin to the [JetBrains Plugins Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com).
To make sure that a plugin is not affected by [API changes](api_changes_list.md), which may happen between major releases of the platform, you can quickly verify your plugin against other IDEs and releases.

 >  [IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-plugin-template) makes it easier to create and maintain your IDE plugins, having the Gradle plugin already integrated and CI covered with GitHub Actions.

 >  If a new plugin will be Scala-based, a dedicated SBT plugin [sbt-idea-plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/sbt-idea-plugin) is available.

 > Please make sure to always upgrade to the [latest version](https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-intellij-plugin/releases) of `gradle-intellij-plugin`.

 > See [What's New & Upgrade Instructions](https://lp.jetbrains.com/gradle-intellij-plugin) for upgrading from pre-1.0 versions.
