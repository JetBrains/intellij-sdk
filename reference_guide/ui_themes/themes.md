title: Custom UI Themes
---

Custom UI Themes give designers control of the appearance of built-in IntelliJ IDEA UI elements. Custom 
UI Themes are distinct from [creating new UI elements](/user_interface_components/user_interface_components.md)
for a plugin. 

Creating a custom UI Theme is a process of choosing a base IntelliJ Theme (_Light_ or _Darcula_) 
then changing aspects of the base Theme definition. Custom UI Themes can:
* substitute icons,
* change the colors of icons and UI controls,
* alter the borders and insets of UI controls,
* provide custom editor schemes,
* add background images.

## The Structure of a UI Theme
UI Themes are components within IntelliJ Platform plugins. Themes can be stand-alone plugins 
or combined with other functionality in a plugin. 

UI Themes have several principal parts:
* A Theme description (JSON) file in the plugin project's source code folder. 
* A `themeProvider` declaration in the plugin's `plugin.xml` file.
* An optional Editor Scheme description (XML) file derived from an exported IntelliJ editor scheme.
This file is declared in the Theme description file and located in a plugin project's resources folder.

## Custom UI Theme Workflow
Creating a UI Theme follows this general sequence:
* [Start with a Plugin Project](https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/getting_started/creating_plugin_project.html)
* [Add UI Theme components to the plugin](#creating-a-ui-theme-with-the-devkit-theme-wizard)
  by using the DevKit UI Theme Wizard.
* [Customize the UI Theme](themes_customize.md) by adding data objects to the Theme description (JSON) file.
* [Add an Editor Scheme or Background Image](themes_extras.md) to the plugin.
* [Build and test](/basics/getting_started/running_and_debugging_a_plugin.md) the UI Theme plugin.
* [Deploy the UI Theme plugin](https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/getting_started/deploying_plugin.html)
* [Publish the UI Theme plugin](https://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/basics/getting_started/publishing_plugin.html) 


## Creating Custom UI Themes

A UI Theme component is
added to a plugin using the DevKit UI Theme Wizard.

### Creating a UI Theme with the DevKit Theme Wizard
To add a UI Theme to a plugin use the DevKit Wizard. While a plugin project is 
open in IntelliJ, select the _**New | Plugin DevKit | Theme**_ action. This Wizard can
be used for both DevKit and Gradle-based plugins.

(Image of menu selecting plugin wizard.)

The Wizard then prompts for the name of the new Theme, and the basis for the Theme:

The name of the new Theme does not have to match the name of the plugin. The checkbox 
indicates the basis for the Theme. Checking _Dark theme_ means basing the custom Theme on
_Darcula_. Leaving the box unchecked means basing the custom Theme on the default IntelliJ _Light_ Theme. 

Clicking the _OK_ button creates a default Theme description file 
with the name `[themeName].theme.json` in the plugin project's `src` directory. 
In this example, the file is named `theme_basics.theme.json`. 
The content of the default file is a short set of keyâ€“value pairs:  
```json
{
 "name": "theme_basics",
 "dark": false,
 "author": "",
 "ui": {
 }
}
```

The `value` of the `name` key defaults to match the name of the first portion 
of the Theme description file. The `value` of `name` is displayed in the 
[Theme](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-appearance.html)  _Preferences_ dropdown 
when the UI Theme's plugin is installed in IntelliJ. The value of the `author` key is 
by default empty. The `ui` section will be addressed in 
[Customizing UI Control Colors](themes_customize.md#Customizing-UI-Control-Colors). 

The Wizard also creates a `themeProvider` declaration in the `<extensions>` 
section of the plugin's `plugin.xml` file. This declaration binds the 
Theme description file to a theme provider extension `id`.
```xml
  <extensions defaultExtensionNs="com.intellij">
    <themeProvider id="eb9b7461-397b-4b98-a422-224fc0a74564" path="/theme_basics.theme.json"/>
  </extensions>
```

At this point, the UI Theme `theme_basics` is a valid UI Theme. Its plugin can 
be built and tested in IntelliJ, giving the user the opportunity to select _theme_basics_
in the [Theme](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-appearance.html) _Preferences_ 
dropdown. At this point the custom Theme looks exactly like the 
IntelliJ default `Light` Theme, but it is a valid Custom Theme.

### Completing the Default UI Theme Description File
The default UI Theme definition can be directly edited to add or change some of the values
for the default keys, if desired:
* The following values can be changed directly in the Theme (`*.theme.json`) description file:
  * The value of the `name` key can be independent of the name of the UI Theme (`*.theme.json`)
    description file. In the case of this code sample, it is `Theme Basics`.
  * The value of the `dark` key can be changed to `true`, which would switch the 
    basis of the Theme to _Darcula_ instead of _Light_.
  * The value of the `author` key, which defaults to an empty string, can be 
    set to a `String` literal. In the case of this example it is set to "IntelliJ Platform SDK".
* The name of the Theme description file, e.g. `theme_basics.theme.json` can be changed, 
  as long as the `path` key of the `<themeProvider>` element (in `plugin.xml`) 
  matches the new file name.

**TODO:**
* capture images for page.
* Document additional syntax from High Contrast theme json file?

**TO RESOLVE:**
* Manual search methodology to find UI control keys in the codebase (given what's known from Laf tool)
* URLs for Light, Darcula, and High Contrast themes in the IntelliJ-community codebase on Github.
* CAN UI Themes be delivered with other functionality?
* How is the Theme GUID assigned by the DevKit Wiz? Could a theme author create the theme.json file and manually add the plugin.xml themeProvider element?
* Does this work with Gradle plugins?
* Can one plugin deliver multiple themes?

**INCLUDE OR DISCARD?**

## Productivity Tips
Before discussing UI Theme customization of UI Themes, here are some suggestions to help speed
the development and testing of a first UI Theme.
 
### Development
Begin simply. Add detail and complexity in small, individually tested steps:
* Get started with a plugin dedicated to a UI Theme without other plugin functionality.
* Begin by customizing colors; these are the easiest to test.
* Then add complexity such as icon substitution, an editor scheme, or a background image. Add these last
  because they introduce requirements for synchronizing filenames, formats, and file locations.

### Testing
Test frequently as you customize a UI Theme. Take advantage of testing within the editor
as well as testing the plugin.

#### UI Theme Description File Syntax Checking in Editor
There are several ways to verify that the UI Theme description file has valid syntax while making changes:
* A check mark is displayed in the upper right corner of the editor window. If
a green check mark turns to red, then there is a syntax error. Often it can be as little as
a misplaced comma.
* The green _run arrow icon_ in the margin to the left of the `name` key will 
change IntelliJ to use the UI Theme being developed in the editor. However, changing the
UI Theme back to a default requires resetting the _Appearance_ preference.

#### Test the Plugin
Testing the plugin containing a custom UI screen
* When IntelliJ completes starting-up, verify the custom Theme is available
via the preferences.
* Select the custom Theme in preferences and verify the Theme is applied.
