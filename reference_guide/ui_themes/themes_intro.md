title: Custom UI Themes
---

Custom UI Themes give designers control of the appearance of built-in IntelliJ IDEA UI elements. 
Custom UI Themes are distinct from [creating new UI elements](/user_interface_components/user_interface_components.md) for a plugin. 

This section discusses creating, customizing and deploying custom UI Themes:
* [Creating UI Themes](themes.md)
* [Customizing UI Themes](themes_customize.md)
* [Adding Editor Schemes and Background Images](themes_extras.md)
